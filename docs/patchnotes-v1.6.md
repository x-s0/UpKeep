## [v1.6] - April 9, 2025

### Overview
Exe, Icon

### New
- Executable
- Icon! (yippie)

### Known Issues
- Some scripts may require administrative privileges to run successfully. (Which isn't really a issue)
- Resizing not supported due to borderless design.
- Limited error handling for invalid script syntax in UpEditor.
- Some colours are bugged when switching back to Light Mode.

### Future Updates
- Add syntax highlighting for UpEditor.

- Expand diagnostic reporting with more detailed system insights.
- Add support for additional script types (e.g., .ps1, .cmd).

### Notes
The big move is still in the plans, but right now i'm exploring ways to not need to make the big move and also hopefully add some quality of life features. For example i'm working on a updater!
